# Hackercat
Created off of  Z3R0th's original code. Instead of it grabbing out from the internet, it launches a local http server and serves the file up to the browser. I also added javascript and hacker text for a little extra pizaz! Everything is embedded into the ps1 script so if you dont have internet in your target's env or want to keep everything memory resident, you can.

Credit to Beefycode for the code for text to speech!
